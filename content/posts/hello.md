Hello, world. I thought I'd build a personal website just for fun, and, since 
I've been wanting to learn Go, I decided to pick up [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), 
the static-site generator. This is my first post. It took about an hour to set 
everything up with GitHub Pages-- not bad!

I'll use this space as a scratchpad to try various features.

## Various features

How about code blocks?

```python
import this

x = [1, 2, 3]
```

And images?

*Fin.*
